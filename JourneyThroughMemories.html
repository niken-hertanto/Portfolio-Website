		<h2> About the Game: </h2>
		<p> In the magical realm of Journey Through Memories, players use their voice to help guide the young witch named Vivi. 
			Set in a 2D storybook world, players use their voice to move Vivi and cast spells to solve through puzzles. Discover the 
			world left behind after the war between witches and humans and help lingering spirits find their peace. This game was made 
			using Unity and C#. <br>
			This game was made to be played with only your voice! This was because I wanted everyone to be able to play a game, even 
			those who are physically disabled with their hands. My mom has arthritis, so she always refused to play games with me since 
			most games are fast-paced. This game is slow and only needs your voice! I want people like my mom to be able to play games 
			and have fun too. Not only that, but I wanted players to feel like a witch and cast their spells.
