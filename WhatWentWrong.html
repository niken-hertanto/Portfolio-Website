		<h2> About the Game: </h2>
		<p> <i>"What Went Wrong"</i> is a 10-page 2D comic game about three friends. The player will play as one of the friends who begins to feel 
		that her two other friends are ignoring her and prefer to spend their time together. Each page represents a week. After the end of 
		a “week,” there is a section for the diary page where the player will need to draw on the page that represents her feelings of that 
		particular page. This game is made using Unity and C#. <br><br>
		This game is currently in pre-production! Because of this, there isn't much to show currently. I will continue to update this page.
